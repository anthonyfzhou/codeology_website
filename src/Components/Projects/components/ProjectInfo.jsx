We will start off with text recognition, sending dms, posting custom messages and joining and leaving voice channels. As we move onto more specific topics, such as drawing from the internet or databases, we will each make custom discord bots better suited to our own vision and interests. Drawing from the discord.py API, this project will allow you to create a bot to jam with while on call with your friends, go on an adventure with in text channels, and make your own discord channel a much more fun and friendly place.",
